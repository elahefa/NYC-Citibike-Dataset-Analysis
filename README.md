This document explores New York Citibike dataset through SQL queries. The dataset can be found in BigQuery public datasets -> new_york.citibike_trips.
## Total number of trips
```

```
## Total number of stations
```

## Total number of bikes
```
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT bikeid) AS num_bikes
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
```
## Total number of bikes by year
```
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR from starttime) as year,  
    COUNT(DISTINCT(bikeid)) as num_bikes
FROM 
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
GROUP BY 
    year
ORDER BY
    year ASC
```
## Average trip duration
```
SELECT AVG(tripduration)/60 AS average_trip_duration
FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`;
```
## Most popular day of the week to bike
```
   SELECT

        day_of_week
    HAVING
        day_of_week IS NOT NULL 
    ORDER BY 
        day_of_week DESC
```
## Average trip length each month
```
SELECT
  EXTRACT(month
  FROM
    starttime) AS month,
   AVG(tripduration)/60 AS avg_duration_in_minutes #SUM(tripduration)/(60*COUNT(*))

## Were there new bike stations introduced or removed at any point in time? What makes you think it did or didnâ€™t?
There were no new bike stations introduced or removed. Using the query below I changed the months and years of timestamp and checked if it gives me any start_station_id. I assumed that if there is any new bike station, people could use that station therefore there should be a start_station_id from that station.
```
SELECT
    start_station_id
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
WHERE (starttime BETWEEN '2013-07-01 00:00:00' AND '2013-07-31 23:59:59') AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT
    start_station_id
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
WHERE
   starttime BETWEEN '2013-08-01 00:00:00' AND '2013-08-31 23:59:59')

```
