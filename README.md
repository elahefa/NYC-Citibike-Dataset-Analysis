## Were there new bike stations introduced or removed at any point in time? What makes you think it did or didnâ€™t?
There were no new bike stations introduced or removed. Using the query below I changed the months and years of timestamp and checked if it gives me any start_station_id. I assumed that if there is any new bike station, people could use that station therefore there should be a start_station_id from that station.
```
SELECT
    start_station_id
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
WHERE (starttime BETWEEN '2013-07-01 00:00:00' AND '2013-07-31 23:59:59') AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT
    start_station_id
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
WHERE
   starttime BETWEEN '2013-08-01 00:00:00' AND '2013-08-31 23:59:59')

```
